# Professional Portfolio & Self-Assessment
## Professional Profile
Completing this computer science program and curating this ePortfolio has been a journey of growth. It has allowed me to narrow down the skills requiring attention while identifying my core strengths in architecture and database design. It also has provided me with the confidence to transition from a typical technology consumer to a skilled developer.

Looking back at my progression, I can visually track my improvement from the introductory courses to the final capstone. Today, as I develop a web application for a personal project, the concepts no longer feel foreign.

### Core Competencies and Values
- **Collaborating in Team Environments:** I have developed a deep appreciation for the importance of delegation and role clarity. Even when working on individual artifacts, I approach development with a team-first mindset.
- **Communicating with Stakeholders:** I focus on bridging the gap between technical requirements and real-world solutions. My goal is always to relay how specific features and background processes directly solve a stakeholder's problem or meet a functional requirement for the consumer.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** My approach to development starts with understanding the full scope of an application’s logic. This foresight allows for more efficient database planning and algorithmic choices that ensure scalability.
- **Software Engineering & Databases:** I believe that a strong understanding of UI/UX directly informs the backend. By visualizing the user interface early on, I can better justify the necessary database schemas and system features required to support the design.
- **Security:** Security is a proactive commitment rather than an afterthought. I prioritize strictly following industry guidelines, implementing encryption, and staying informed on evolving "hacker trends" to protect user data.

## Artifact Summaries
**1. Milestone 1: Code Review**\
Focus: Quality Assurance & Technical Analysis\
This milestone involved a rigorous review of code from a previous course. The objective was to confirm logical correctness and identify potential flaws. This exercise sharpened my "developer's eye," teaching me that high-quality software begins with the ability to critique and refine existing logic to ensure stability and efficiency.

**2. Milestone 2: Software Design and Engineering**\
Focus: UI/UX & Iterative Problem Solving\
This artifact showcases a mobile application UI redesign of the Facebook app. By evaluating usability issues in the current interface, I applied modern design principles to create a more intuitive experience.

The Enhancement: I restructured the application into three task-oriented screens: a streamlined News Feed, an expanded Post View, and a dedicated Post Creation screen.\
Key Skills: Implementation of bottom navigation bars, floating action buttons, and accessibility-focused layouts.

**3. Milestone 3: Algorithms and Data Structures**\
Focus: Technical Strategy & Architectural Planning\
This project involved a comprehensive Application Development Proposal for an event management system (covering ticket searching, booking, and post-event management).

The Enhancement: I transformed an initial document into a technical blueprint by integrating the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and the MVVM architectural pattern.\
Key Skills: Utilizing RESTful APIs and optimizing data handling for algorithmic efficiency and scalability.

**4. Milestone 4: Databases**\
Focus: Data Integrity & Security Implementation\
Building upon the previous proposal, this milestone focused on the "backbone" of the application. It demonstrates my ability to design robust data storage systems and secure sensitive information.

The Enhancement: I defined four distinct MongoDB collections with specific data types and fields, justifying the use of NoSQL for its flexibility and horizontal scaling.\
Security Focus: I integrated advanced security strategies, including password hashing, at-rest and in-transit encryption, and a Key Management System (KMS) to handle encryption keys.
